This is a simple C# windows application developed for practice purposes to help users track their weight over time. The program allows you to input a date and your weight, and then save that information to a custom-named file.

Note: This app is only intended to be opened and run in Visual Studio and is not packaged for general download or use.

ðŸ’¡ Features
Input your weigh-in date and weight.

Save each entry to a file with a custom file name.

View your progress by keeping records across multiple files.

Lightweight and easy-to-use console interface.

Built purely in C# using basic file I/O and console interaction.

Requirements
Visual Studio (any recent version)

NET SDK installed (compatible with your Visual Studio version)

How to Run
Clone or download the project folder to your computer.

Open the solution in Visual Studio.

Build the project (Ctrl+Shift+B) to ensure everything is set up.

Press Start to run the application.

How It Works
The app prompts the user to:

Enter a date (e.g. 2025-07-23)

Enter a weight (e.g. 85.6 kg)

You are then asked to enter a file name.

The app saves your entry (date and weight) into the specified file.

You can repeat the process to create new entries or files in the future.

Disclaimer
This project was created solely for learning and experimentation with C# and file handling in a console environment. It is not intended for production use or for public distribution.
